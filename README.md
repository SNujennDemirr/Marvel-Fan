# Marvel Fan

Marvel Fan is my first project, created during my school years when I was just beginning to learn programming. I built it to explore what I could achieve with basic HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. 

## Features

- A list of Marvel movies
- Detailed information about the movies
- Short video clips for each movie

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/marvel-fan.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd marvel-fan
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.


Here are some screenshots from the Marvel Fan project
