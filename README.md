# Marvel Fan

Marvel Fan is my first project, created during my school years when I was just beginning to learn programming. I built it to explore what I could achieve with basic HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Donâ€™t expect anything advanced.

## Features

- A list of Marvel movies
- Detailed information about the movies
- Short video clips for each movie

    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
